# aristotlebot
A bot for citing the works of Aristotle.

First will use the medieval method of citation (Work, book, chapter, sentence#) eg: [Ethic. v, 5] (this contains no sentence number; Aquinas was referring to the whole chapter)

Once this works, we will attempt to get him working with [Bekker Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekker_numbering) as well.
